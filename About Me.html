    <p>&emsp;On Octuber 31, the school year in Guatemala ended. I left school to start working with my unle as a truck helper, it was when I was 12 years old, I worked with him for 6 years. I wanted to continue studyng to be a computer scientist, but due to the economic situation I couldn't and my dad didn't want to, my mom became sad because she also wanted me to continue studyng, but neither she and I could do anything, when I stopped studing I thought that my dream was over.</p>
     <p>&emsp;In February, 2018 I decided to immigrate to the United States, on my journey I crossed all of mexico to get to the United States, I spent 10 days in the desert of the border between Mexico an the United States, in those 1o days I spent 6 days without eathing anything, I only had half a liter of water and that helped me in those 6 days. After 22-days journey, I arriev in the USA. I was detained by immigration agents and then they sent me to New York.</p>
     <p>&emsp;All my family are in my country, when I was arrested, I was sent with a foster mom in New York and here I had the opportunity to start studying again  and make my dream of becoming an compiuter scintist come true.</p></article>
